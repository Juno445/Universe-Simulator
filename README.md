# Universe-Simulator
Designed to act as a sandbox to better understand classic and quantum physics puzzles.

## Environments

1.) classic_universe.py is a base model that utilizes known, foundational science to predict the location of an object in the space.

2.) butterfly_effect.py tries to take this a step further, and introduces the quantum element by attempting to measure what happens as a result of an interaction.

## Goals
We aim to build as realistic of a universe as we can, factoring in the known laws, constants, and current unknowns.
